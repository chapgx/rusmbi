# RUSMBI

This is a version of rhombi/rhombifer. It aims to be an unopinionated CLI Library. There are two other repos one in [GO](https://go.dev/) and one in [ODIN](https://odin-lang.org/). I'm writing it in multiple languages for personal learning puposes.

RHOMBIFER IN GO: [RHOMBIFER](https://github.com/racg0092/rhombifer)

RHOMBIFER IN ODIN: [ORHOMBI](https://github.com/chapgx/orhombi)

Library is in active development and may introduce breaking changes in future versions
